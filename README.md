# Assignment: Convert Callback-based Code to Promises and Async/Await

##  Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the refactoring of callback-based asynchronous operations into Promise-based syntax using `async/await` in Node.js for better readability and error handling.



##  Files Included

- `callback.js` – Uses traditional Node.js callbacks for async file operations.
- `async-await.js` – Refactored version using Promises and `async/await`.
- `input.txt` – A sample input file used in both scripts.
- `output.txt` – The output file created/updated by both scripts.



##  What This Code Does

1. **Reads** data from `input.txt`
2. **Transforms** the content to uppercase
3. **Writes** the transformed content to `output.txt`
4. **Reads** the content from `output.txt` and prints it
